# Week 1 of METIS Bootcamp in the History Books

WOW!!! What an amazing week!!! Last week past by quickly, there were a lot of emotions (mostly positive :smiley:). I got to meet my fellow cohorts and they are an interesting fun loving bunch. A lot of new interesting tools and techniques were introduced to us. All of them were informative that I will be using as a new Data Scientist.  


During Week 1, we were tasked with a project that helped us strengthen our skills in EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). We had to analyze NYC MTA turnstile data and give a recommendation on which station would produce the highest number of signups for the Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY) Gala.   



This was a team project and I was lucky to be paired with Johnathan and Krishna. After a day of brainstorming we decided to compare the turnstile data and match it to the top 20 tech companies within New York. In order for us to do this we would have to find out who were the top tech companies in NYC, therefore we used [Built In NYC's](https://www.builtinnyc.com/2017/11/07/nyc-top-100-tech-companies-2017) website. In addition we decided to create an interactive map that will enable the user to see the closest stations to the top 20 tech companies. Another challenge we had to overcome was matching closest train stations to the top 20 tech companies, where we used [Chris Hong's NYC turnstile geocode (raw)](https://github.com/chriswhong/nycturnstiles/raw/master/geocoded.csv) to match latitude and longitude.    



If it wasn't for the expertise of Johnathan we would not have been able to web scrape the top 20 tech companies. Krishna was good at using mapping tools therefore we used folium to create the NYC maps. While I did not do much of the coding I definitely was a good resource when it came to merging our data since I come from a strong SQL (Structured Query Language) background. I worked on the presentation slides while coding was being handled by Johnathan and Krishna. Another drawback we faced was we could not all code at the same time and I think given more time we would have been able to delegate coding responsibilities equally.   



Our final recommendation was an interactive map where we were able to see the closest train stations near the top 20 tech companies (based on number of employees) where volunteers could be placed to get the highest number of sign ups.   



In conclusion if I had to work on this project by myself I most probably would have gone with a different approach since I had no exposure to web scraping and folium. I am glad that I got to work with Johnathan and Krishna since I got exposed to new Data Science tools early in the Bootcamp.
